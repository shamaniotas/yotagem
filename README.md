Browser Mining for Satoshi
-------------------------

Special Advanced Developer Alpha Preview at:
https://shaman-labz.appspot.com/ 

coming soon also as yotagem.com and yotagem.org
https://yotagem.appspot.com/ 

The splash screen is just to keep casual surfers from stopping in and messing with Shaman's chi or growing the database too quickly as dev does not have all governors currently implemented/enabled.

To get past the splash screen:
* make a donation 
* or see if you can find the back door (hint view-source).
